I took over this challenge for the team and created a checker resource texture that would be used later by every default texture when importing a model or creating a primitive. The colour texture was a must later in the project since only a single model crashed and gave errors. I ended up reading from the \'.fbx\' file what was the texture data and extracting the colour from there.

In my project, I created a plugin that can attach to any Unity game and adjust the game\'s mechanics in real time as the user is playing the game. The plugin creates a user profile according to the specific actions it captures. To test if my hypothesis was correct, I conducted a playtesting session with an open-source game I applied the plugin.

The player\'s actions update their profile, also known as the Output. This change in the profile is reflected in the variable features that update the game accordingly. Each variable feature is encoded so that it can be modified (in different ways and multiple times) using a feature coefficient, which is calculated considering the entirety of the profile. This calculation implies that the feature modification is tailored around the player.</p><p>To do so, each variable feature will be given by the developer a relevance value for each player type, having six relevance values for each variable feature on the table. The player profile is used to know the correspondence for each player type, and, combined with the relevance from the table, the final feature coefficient gets calculated. The exact mathematical formula is shown in the images section below.</p><p>The feature relevance is simply the value on the table for the designated feature and player type. This value indicates how relevant the player type is for the feature (how much the feature depends on this player type). This value will go from 0 - 0 to -1 - 1. The player correspondence is the player type value from the profile. This value indicates if the type feature coefficient will result positively or negatively. In the image section below there are two figures representing the type feature coefficient. Importantly, these graphics use the default numbers for the ranges of both feature relevance and player correspondence.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Practical Implementation","text":"<p>All the implementation done and problems found (and their resolution) regarding applying the plugin to the Unity 2D Roguelike Shooter are explained below.

In my project, I created a plugin that can attach to any Unity game and adjust the game\'s mechanics in real time as the user is playing the game. The plugin creates a user profile according to the specific actions it captures. To test if my hypothesis was correct, I conducted a playtesting session with an open-source game I applied the plugin. Afterwards, I analysed the gathered data and made final remarks on my conclusions.</p>","textBlocks":[{"subtitle":"Features","text":"<p>It\'s main features are:</p><ul><li>Table of Gameplay Features</li><li>Plugin Internal Design</li><li>AB Testing</li><li>Analysis</li><li>Theoretical Implementation</li><li>Project Validation</li><li>Future Work</li></ul>"},{"subtitle":"Table of Gameplay Features","text":"<p>This table was created from the compendium from two different sources (the Periodic Table of Gamification Elements and the table in Gamification Tactics by The Idea) and the student\'s knowledge and criteria, and the six HEXAD types. Only some of the gameplay features were considered modifiable, and two of the six types were discarded after some evaluation. The final table relates de relevance of each feature for each type by the use of a numerical value, yielding a matrix of 26 modifiable features for the Achiever, Free Spirit, Player and Philanthropist player types.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Plugin Internal Design","text":"<p>The plugin\'s main feature was to act reactively to player interaction from the start of the project. As the user acts and plays the game, certain actions such as completing quests, taking damage and exploring the current zone will trigger Unity Events, which will update the player profile. These actions will be referred to as Inputs. This update in the profile\'s state will go through the table of features using an algorithm and result in an update of the features coefficient (number representing the impact of the entirety of the player profile on each feature, ranging from -1 to 1). This chain reaction will result in the game getting updated constantly, as it uses these coefficients every time new content is generated in the game. When the game uses these coefficients to create or modify an aspect of the game it will be referred to as Outputs.</p>"},{"subtitle":"AB Testing","text":"<p>An AB testing method was carried out to assess the plugin performance, validating the effectiveness of the project. All users who participated in the test were assigned a test group: A, B or C. All groups underwent two runs, in which the user was allowed freedom to do as they pleased inside the game until they died. A series of questions were asked regarding their experience after each run, which were the same for both runs. Allowing the user to answer the survey questions from within the game (using sliders) meant that the user was not presented with the choice to skip it. Having the survey in-game made the overall experience simpler. The two runs are briefly explained below.</p><h4>First Run</h4><p>The initial run would be made using the game \'Unity 2D Roguelike Shooter\' without any modifications (aside from fixing any non-functioning elements and adding them in the data gathering system). This run was used as an anchor for all groups. The test consisted of a gameplay phase ending with a survey, which is explained in more detail further in the document. At the end of this first run, before the survey takes place, an initial question asks about what they believe their player profile is.</p><h4>Second Run</h4><p>This second run would follow the same steps as the initial one by having a gameplay phase with a survey at the end. The difference from the first run depended on the test group assigned to the user. For <em>group A</em>, this second run acted as a test for the placebo effect, to see if the users would feel any difference even though no changes had been made to the game. For groups B and C, the second run used the plugin to adapt all the features according to the player\'s profile. By having the plugin active, these features would be changing constantly because the game updates the user\'s profile in real time as the player triggers certain events or takes certain actions. This process ultimately results in making the user feel a unique experience. More specifically, for <em>group B</em>, their initial profile values were equal to their final values during the first run to further encourage the user\'s profile. This group is expected to have a positive experience, yielding a more enjoyable run (this was analysed with the user\'s opinion on the game\'s difficulty, plugin\'s adaptability and user enjoyment). For <em>group C</em>, their initial values were completely opposed to the final values of their first run, encouraging a different playstyle than the user was acting in their initial run. This group\'s run was intended to promote a negative effect on the users as they were forced to act differently to their predisposed playstyle. Having said this, we also expected players to notice the effects of the plugin more significantly, even though the initial values were opposed to their playstyle, the plugin still adapted according to their actions (moving the values back to their preferred position).</p><p>After the second run, a thank you message showed up with a quit button as the test was over. The last thing the user needed to do was return the file with the survey data for it to be collected and analysed.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Analysis","text":"<p>From the test, the data gathered and analysed was the following: their initial and final profile values for each run, the answers given regarding their experience (the perception of their profile, the game\'s difficulty, the plugin\'s adaptability and their enjoyment) and the statistics for each run (enemy deaths, rooms cleared, shots fired and time played).</p><p>All the data extracted from the test was collected and grouped into three different \'.csv\' files:</p><ul><li><em>Profiles</em>, where the user-inputted profile was stored</li><li><em>Run one</em>, where all data about the first run was stored</li><li><em>Run two</em>, where all the data about the second run was stored</li></ul><br><p>To analyse this data, the programs R and RStudio were used making use of the student\'s knowledge in R language gained during the degree. For any predictions and calculations with error, the range used was 95% certainty, the standard in the data analysis world. All data analysed was compared between the first and second runs, and for each test group. Despite analysing all the data, the main focus was on the questions regarding their experience.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Theoretical Implementation","text":"<p>The idea of the plugin is to be able to be used by any desired game. To further prove that, an implementation of it onto well-rated and beloved video games has been made on a design level.</p><p>The games have been chosen according to the following criteria:</p><ul><li>They had to be famous and valued by a big portion of the gaming community</li><li>They had to belong to different game categories, and therefore, different playstyles</li></ul><br><p>As stated before, the implementation can be done in the input and the output. The more adaptations (inputs and outputs) the game has, the better experience the player should have. For these design examples, about ten inputs and outputs were designed per game. Regarding the output, the triggers that modify the player profile have been assigned an estimated value, but this should be tested and tweaked before being released to the public.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Project Validation","text":"<p>The project validation can be appreciated through the post-production analysis. On one hand, the AB testing done after applying the plugin to the chosen open-source game demonstrates its effectiveness in making the experience more adaptable and enjoyable. Moreover, all player profiles studied were coherent across the two runs. On the other hand, the successful theoretical implementation of other popular video games suggests that the plugin is versatile and general enough to act upon multiple kinds of games.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Future Work","text":"<p>Once the project has ended, the student analysed aspects of the work to be improved on if more time had been available.

Each has its own territories, cultures, beliefs, political structures and secret societies. We wanted them to be related to different parts of the body to connect them with a pseudo-RPG game. As such, we ended up with four distinct societies:</p><h4>The Vagrants</h4><p>People affected by the radiation in their muscles that lack the mental capabilities for them to have properly developed any civilization. Other people will regard them as nothing more than cattle, removing any humanity they still could have and delegating them to mere resources and manpower.</p><h4>The Osseous Tribes</h4><p>Bone scavengers that adopted a wild lifestyle, dividing themselves into different nomad matriarchal tribes that keep moving around the zone of Trentenwick. As their tribes are based on bones, they often wear them as trophies or necklaces and its people are also named after scientific bone names gathered from old notes of the Old World.</p><h4>The Bloody Legion</h4><p>Hemokinetic people with their empire at the Crimson Eclipse. They believe themselves to be the biggest empire, aiming to become the most powerful. Their leader, \'Golden Blood\', is the only 0- type left in the world, having a lot of influence in other societies, working as aristocrats, even owning vagrant farms to be able to extract their blood to store it.</p><h4>The Techmant Society</h4><p>The few humans with the neuron affliction have all gathered themselves as a secret technocratic society in the Barrenwaters, specifically located in the ruined remains of Thorpenden. Its members consist mostly of scientists, investigators and brilliant minds with the mental capacity to overcome the sudden influx of overwhelming sensations and brain power. They are the only ones actively trying to put a solution to the freezing sun.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Main Characters","text":"<p>A few characters have been fleshed out more than the rest. Here are some of their personal goals:</p><h4>Christopher Bridges</h4><p>Even though he begins being very bitter and untrusting, he will start to create an unconventional friendship with Coccyx and, eventually, with Vincent, as they all start to meet and trust each other in the hardships they encounter. Coccyx will help him survive and overcome his inner demons, and Vincent will be an example of giving people a second chance.</p><h4>Coccyx</h4><p>In her first meeting, Chris and her will have high tensions with each other despite their limited interactions. She will be presented as the tribe\'s \'antagonistic\' force, as she will demean him for being a pale, unscarred man incapable of surviving in the wild.</p><h4>Vincent V. Donovan</h4><p> At the beginning of the story, Vincent saves and protects Chris from the dangers posed to him in Putridpoint, appearing himself as the best friend during the first act. However, this is all a trick to lead him into a trap set by the Bloody Legion\'s insurgence group to capture and use Chris for their deeds. His treason will mark an important twist in their relationship, as it gets strained due to the circumstances.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Resources","text":"<p>The most important relationships come from the two most powerful factions. The Osseous Tribes work as bounty hunters of Vagrants to be exploited by the crimson aristocracy\'s farms. In exchange, the aristocracy gives out the curated skeletal remains of the bodies and several other goods to the tribes\' interests. Meanwhile, each of the factions has several emissaries in charge of exchanging important resources to the neuron\'s society for them to try and stop the still imminent Sun freezing.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Itemization","text":"<p>Often, the player may have to use items to protect themselves from the dangerous world ahead.
