I wanted it to be just like it is in the real world where the farther away from the planet the less pull the object feels.

We knew that ususally to debug the hitbox of an object the hitbox becomes a solid half-transparent block but with the circles we didn\'t know how to do it. In the end we ended up covering the entirety of the surface with dots by making lines coming out from the center point of the circle.That way we could even adjust the density of the dots by incrementing the degrees between a line and the next. I thought it was a clever way of doing that.</p><h4>Internal Timer & dt</h4><p>Along with Sebastian Delgado Vargas, we added an internal timer that was compatible with our engine\'s calculations and general structure. After having that we also added the dt to know the amount of time that had passed in the last frame of the game. All of these variables are being used throught private methods to keep everything in check and the least confusing as possible.</p><h4>Buoyancy</h4><p>With the help of Sebastian Delgado Vargas, we coded the buoyancy for the ending of the game where the saucer has to crash into the ocean to be saved. We programmed it as close to how it works in the real world as we could.</p><h4>Drag Force</h4><p>I programmed how the drag force would behave on Earth eventhough it\'s not exactly how it is in the real world.</p><h4></h4>Code Cleaning<p>I am a very organized person and I hate not having clean and neatly commented code.

Recreation of the 1989 classic from arcades by Bruhmentium INC.<br>Pang (also known as Buster Bros. in the North American release and Pomping World in the Japanese) is a videogame created in 1989 by Mitchell Corporation that consists in two players cooperating in destroying various bubbles bouncing around the screen.

I must say I had some troube with the corners but in the end I am happy how it turned out.</p><h4>Balloons</h4><p>I programmed the main enemies of the game, the balloons. There are three types of balloons each splitting into two of the smaller size (except the smallest one of course). They vary in the strength of the bounce and the hitbox. I also coded their popping particles when dying.</p><h4>Weapon PowerUps</h4><p>With the help of Arnau Lucena Cobo, I made all the powerups.<br>- Double Wire: Twin harpoon that allows for having two shots at once<br>- Power Wire: Grappling hook that stays attached to the ceiling<br>- Vulcan Missile: High-caliber gun that works much like a machine gun<br>- Force Field: Item that allows the player to take a hit and kill the balloon that was damaging it<br>- Hourglass: Item that slows the balloons<br>- Clock: Item that stops the balloons for a short time<br>- Dynamite: Item that pops all the balloons down to their smallest size<br>- Extra Life: Item that appears after destroying all the blocks of certain stages. Sometimes appears after popping some balloons.</p>"},{"subtitle":"Secondary Tasks","text":"<h4>Module Fonts</h4><p>I implemented the module fonts since we had the fonts of the original arcade game, that way we could use the font in the game as we pleased making creating the UI very easy.</p><h4>Module Tileset</h4><p>We also implemented a way to quickly make multiple levels using a simple array with numbers signifying the type of tile that should be placed when creating the level.</p><h4>Player Death</h4><p>Along with Guillem Álava Burgueño I did the death animation where the character bounces off the screen.</p><h4>QA & Bugfixing</h4><p>I was the one on the team who did most bugfixing since most of it was due to the physics bugging out and the balloon bouncing off walls incorrectly.</p><h4>Timer</h4><p>I implemented a timer that resets each stage. This timer is used for giving points and also if it reaches zero the player loses.</p><h4>Level Platforms & Stairs</h4><p>I had some problems with handling the platforms since I didn\'t know how to calculate if it was a wall or ground to differenciate between the different bounces (ground doesn\'t change direction). I had also some problems with the stairs since the player can always jump off the stairs or shoot. In the end everything got sorted out and fixed.</p><h4>Before Delivery Checkups</h4><p>I was in charge of checking the naming conventions, cleanups and fixing the code to fit our coding style. It was a laborious task but it was imperative to get right since the punishment was failing the subject.</p>"}],"links":[{"name":"Pang Repo","link":"https://github.com/WillyTrek19/PANG"},{"name":"Pang Wiki","link":"https://github.com/WillyTrek19/PANG/wiki"}],"tags":["C++","SDL"]},{"id":14,"title":"Particle System","initialDate":"2021-02-28","finalDate":"2021-04-20","teamSize":"1","employer":"CITM | UPC","images":["particle_system_1.jpg","particle_system_2.jpg","particle_system_3.jpg","particle_system_4.jpg","particle_system_5.jpg"],"animGif":[{"gif":"particle_system.gif","static":"particle_system_static_gif.jpg"}],"videos":[],"introduction":"<p>Particle System is a particle module created for \'Project 2\' subject in the Bachelor\'s degree in Video Game Design and Development at the CITM-UPC center, Barcelona, under the supervision of Ramon Santamaría Pena(<a href=\'https://github.com/raysan5\'>@raysan5</a>).
